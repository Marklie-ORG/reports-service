# reports-service Rules

- Purpose: Reporting pipelines, schedules, and providers. Node/Express with pnpm; source under `app/src`.
- Commands:
  - Install: `cd app && corepack enable && pnpm i`
  - Dev: `cd app && pnpm watch`
  - Build: `cd app && pnpm build:all`
- Conventions:
  - Controllers in `lib/controllers`, services in `lib/services`, providers in `lib/providers`.
  - Validate DTOs; keep provider interfaces typed. Prefer `markly-ts-core` for shared contracts.
  - Keep edits focused; avoid broad refactors.
- Cross-service:
  - Align FB data schemas with `agencies-api` and frontend types when relevant.
  - Update `markly-ts-core` when adding shared enums/interfaces.
